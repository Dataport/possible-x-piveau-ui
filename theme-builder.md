## Piveau Theme builder

Given that the highly optimized files generated by vue.js are not suitable for creating Themes on runtime, the closest approach to have a "Theme" is to build the distribution files from source files.

Such theme consists of a reduced set of files that can be modified with a minimal understand of CSS and HTML.

In this case this is achieved by encapsulating most of the needed vue.js files into a docker image. Users only need to modify the folders "src" and "public". Everything else will be automatically delivered through the docker images.

## How does it followKeywordLinks

1. Use the theme-builder-docker-compose.yml to launch the needed containers with the correspoinding volumes.
2. An instance of piveau-hub-ui will be launched in the port 17080.
3. You can now replace the files in the volumes "public" and "src" with your own files.  
4. Restart the container "theme-builder". And wait until the process finishes. (See the container logs to see the progress)
5. Reload the local piveau-hub-ui (localhost:17080)
